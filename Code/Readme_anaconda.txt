To run the code of this work, I recommond to use the jupyter notebook, because it is a interactive programming tool and very suitable to complete the machine learning task. I also recommend to install anaconda as the Python environment. But it includes the complete package we need in this work.

1, Go to https://www.anaconda.com/, download and install the Anaconda of the version that fit your computer.

2, Create a new environment.

3, Install Packages.
Packages list:
iPython
Jupyter notebook
Keras
Matplotlib
Numpy
Pandas
Qtpy
Scipy
scikit-learn
Tensorflow

4, Open Anaconda, cd to the code workspace, activate the environment, and click the 'ipynb' file.

I also recommond to use google colab https://colab.research.google.com, which is with high performance cloud GPU and it's free!
